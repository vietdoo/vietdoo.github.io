Hi, I'm Do Quoc Viet, a Data Science major at the University of Science, VNU-HCM. My passion for programming began with competitive programming focused on data structures and algorithms, and has since expanded to Machine Learning and Big Data. 

I'm deeply focused on Big Data frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and BigQuery. I'm always seeking new learning opportunities and have developed skills in C/C++, Python3, SQL, NoSQL, ETLs, Data Warehousing, Visualization, web server technologies, backend development, Linux, Docker, and networking. My strengths include determination, quick learning, and teamwork. I'm excited to continue developing my skills in Data Engineering.
